1 specter dust for 2 plants. #animatorID: 2 #anim: 2Plants

Let’s see...
We’ve got Past Plants, Future Plants, Newbie Plants…
January, March, December blooms are still around. The rest? Gone.
Also… 2050s vines, 2000s roots, two-hundred-and-22’s.
And a few cannibal plants, but you probably don’t want those.
Call me Dun. #animatorID: 2 #anim: NameDun
Like “June” but say it wrong and I’ll pretend I didn’t hear you. #speaker: Dun #anim: NameDunTalk

You think about all of the options. #speaker:
Long long time ago, you and him would travel around the world.
He'd buy you ice scream, and you held his hand while walking under the 
stars. 
But you forgot his name.

... #speaker: You
+[Can I have an ice cube please?]
-> Next 
 
== Next ==
... #speaker Dun 
...Did you just say ice cube? #anim: NameDunTalk

Do I look like an ice cube to you? #anim: NameDunTalk

Look, kiddo. 
I ain't wanna look like an evil snake #anim: NameDunTalk
But if you keep drifting through like some blank page,
I’ll toss you out like wilted moss.

Grow up. Or go home. 

And- 
Let me guess, a blonde guy brought you here? #anim: NameDunTalk
Physically, he isn't a man but... whatever.

... #speaker: You
+[Yes]

Sign... #speaker: Dun 
That man... He's doing it again. #animatorID: 2 #anim: Warning

Just want to give you a warning.
See the scar on my face? 
That was the consequence of choosing the wrong person.
Don't trust anyone in this world, anyone but yourself. #anim: Trust

-> END
